Here\\'s how big it is exactly. If your PIN is six-digits long, an attacker would need to go through around 1 million combinations to crack it, and if you\\'re Kanye West, they would need far fewer. If, on the other hand, you have a password that\\'s six characters long but consists of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and special characters, the hackers are looking at around 690 billion possible combinations. Shoulder surfing is also easier with numeric PINs.",
